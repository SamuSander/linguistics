CODEBOOK FOR THE EXAMPLE DATA FOR THE PSYCHOMOTOR VIGILANCE TASK
See psychomotor_vigilance_example_data.csv

GENERAL NOTE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

When we use this task, we typically exclude participants from data analysis
who have more than 20% lapses (defined as reaction times > 1000 ms) or more than
20% prematures (defined as reaction times < 150 ms). For actual data analysis,
one usually defines lapses as rt > 500 ms and prematures as rt < 100.
This means that the criteria we use for excluding entire data sets from single
participants are not the same criteria we use for individual trials in the
final data analysis.

COLUMNS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The following columns are recorded from this version of the PVT:

view_history
When using the instructions plugin, participants can click through several pages.
This column records how much time they spent on each page, whether they returned
to the previous at some point etc.

rt
Reaciton time in milliseconds. Is null when the participant does not react (in time).

trial
We record what trial participants are in. There is the start screen (beginning
of the task) and instructions. For the pvt task itself, there is the fixation period,
followed by the stopwatch, followed by feedback. Trials starting with "practice_"
denote practice trials, trials of the main task are marked with "main_".

trial_type
Which jsPsych plugin was used for this trial.

trial_index
Trial number, in the order they appear during the experiment, across all trials
(including instructions).

time_elapsed
How much time has elapsed since the beginning of the experiment in ms.

internal_node_id
Trial node recorded by jsPsych. Has different levels because trials are organised
hierarchically (e.g. sub-trials of a timeline).

stimulus
What was presented during the trial - will store the entire html code.

response
The response participants gave. Will be a button number if there were buttons,
or a keyboard input if one was requested.

pvt_iti
Duration of the fixation (waiting) period of the pvt.

correct
Whether participants stopped the stopwatch in time (i.e. they were slower than
a premature response, but faster than a lapse).

pvt_stopwatch
What the stopwatch (html) was displaying at the time. Note that there are slight
discrepancies between what the stopwatch displays and what is stored in rt.
