CODEBOOK FOR THE MINI‑Q JSPSYCH DATA
See mini_q.csv

GENERAL NOTE ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
from Schubert, A. L., Löffler, C., Wiebel, C., Kaulhausen, F., & Baudson, T. G. (2024). Don't waste your time measuring intelligence: Further evidence for the validity of a three-minute speeded reasoning test. Intelligence, 102, 101804.

The test materials consist of a 64‑item speeded reasoning task (mini‑Q) implemented in jsPsych. 
Each trial presents a verbal statement and a figural arrangement of a circle (C), triangle (T), spacer (S), and square (V). 
The code automatically compares the participant’s response to the pre‑specified correctAnswer for each item. 
In online deployments, hide or obfuscate the JavaScript variables containing the solutions so that participants cannot inspect them in the console.

COLUMNS --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
success, timeout, failed_images
These fields come from the preload plugin. They indicate whether assets loaded correctly at the start of the experiment.

trial_type
The jsPsych plugin used (e.g. html-button-response)

trial_index
Sequential trial number across the entire experiment, including instructions and preload trials

time_elapsed
Milliseconds elapsed since the experiment began

internal_node_id
jsPsych’s hierarchical identifier for the trial within nested timelines

stage
Custom label marking “practice” or “test” trials

question
The German prompt shown (e.g. “Das Dreieck zieht das Viereck vor”)

shapes
A four‑character code for left‑to‑right figure order: C = Circle, T = Triangle, S = Spacer, V = Square

correctAnswer
Ground‑truth for each item as defined in items_mini_q.js (1 = true, 0 = false)

response
Participant’s choice: 0 = “false” button, 1 = “true” button; null if no response

rt
Reaction time in milliseconds; null if no response

correct
Boolean flag indicating response === correctAnswer (true = correct, false = incorrect or timeout)

item_index
1‑based index of the test item within the 64‑item set

stimulus
Full HTML string displayed on the trial (includes table, shapes, etc.)

DERIVED METRICS -------------------------------------------------------------------------
total_score
Sum of all correct responses across the 64 test trials

accuracy_rate
total_score divided by 64

completion_time
time_elapsed at the last test trial minus time_elapsed at the first test trial

Exclude instruction and practice trials when computing summary metrics.
